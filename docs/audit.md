Unfortunately, I was unable to get the Google map function to appear in Chrome (the method to simulate the app), so I can only speak for the rest of the app. Based on the accessibility guidelines from appt.org, the contrast ratio for the text and background is at least 4.5:1. Additionally, it’s usable with a screen reader, providing important text to audio for any of the visually impaired, especially for an already under-supported community that this app is intended for. I personally found the distance in m to the locations to be smaller than i’d like, but it’s incredibly unlikely that it raises any significant issues. So it will not be included as accessibility issues, especially when there are options like the screen reader to address this if it does become significant.
